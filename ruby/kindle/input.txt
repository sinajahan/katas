communicate as one: generate a brand. When you start a project, come up with a name for it, ideally something off-the-wall.

Don’t just test your code, but test your assumptions as well. Don’t guess; actually try it. Write an assertion to test your assumptions (see Assertive Programming, page 122). If your assertion is right, you have improved the documentation in your code. If you discover your assumption is wrong, then count yourself lucky.

Don’t be a slave to history. Don’t let existing code dictate future code. All code can be replaced if it is no longer appropriate. Even within one program, don’t let what you’ve already done constrain what you do next—be ready to refactor (see Refactoring, page 184). This decision may impact the project schedule. The assumption is that the impact will be less than the cost of not making the change.1

1. Don’t try to refactor and add functionality at the same time. 2. Make sure you have good tests before you begin refactoring. Run the tests as often as possible. That way you will know quickly if your changes have broken anything.

3. Take short, deliberate steps: move a field from one class to another, fuse two similar methods into a superclass. Refactoring often involves making many localized changes that result in a larger-scale change. If you keep your steps small, and test after each step, you will avoid prolonged debugging.

But even though it’s obvious, that doesn’t stop people from trying the same thing—over and over—thinking there must be a way. Of course, there isn’t. The solution lies elsewhere.

more detail: 1 Spring instantiates the bean. 2 Spring injects values and bean references into the bean’s properties. 3 If the bean implements BeanNameAware, Spring passes the bean’s ID to thesetBeanName() method. 4 If the bean implements BeanFactoryAware, Spring calls the setBeanFactory() method, passing in the bean factory itself. 5 If the bean implements ApplicationContextAware, Spring will call the setApplicationContext() method, passing in a reference to the enclosing application context. 6 If any of the beans implement the BeanPostProcessor interface, Spring calls their postProcessBeforeInitialization() method. 7 If any beans implement the InitializingBean interface, Spring calls their afterPropertiesSet() method. Similarly, if the bean was declared with an init-method, then the specified initialization method will be called. 8 If there are any beans that implement BeanPostProcessor, Spring will call their postProcessAfterInitialization() method. 9 At this point, the bean is ready to be used by the application and will remain in the application context until the application context is destroyed. 10 If any beans implement the DisposableBean interface, then Spring will call their destroy() methods. Likewise, if any bean was declared with a destroymethod, then the specified method will be called.

The benefit of configuring data sources in this way is that they can be managed completely external to the application, allowing the application to ask for a data source when it’s ready to access the database. Moreover, data sources managed in an application server are often pooled for greater performance and can be hot-swapped by system administrators.

“You are prepared to give your lives?” “Yes.” “You are prepared to commit murder?” “Yes.” “To commit acts of sabotage which may cause the death of hundreds of innocent people?” “Yes.” “To betray your country to foreign powers?” “Yes.” “You are prepared to cheat, to forge, to blackmail, to corrupt the minds of children, to distribute habit-forming drugs, to encourage prostitution, to disseminate venereal diseases -- to do anything which is likely to cause demoralization and weaken the power of the Party?” “Yes.” “If, for example, it would somehow serve our interests to throw sulphuric acid in a child’s face -- are you prepared to do that?” “Yes.” “You are prepared to lose your identity and live out the rest of your life as a waiter or a dockworker?” “Yes.” “You are prepared to commit suicide, if and when we order you to do so?” “Yes.” “You are prepared, the two of you, to separate and never see one another again?” “No!” broke in Julia.

A front controller is a common web application pattern where a single servlet delegates responsibility for a request to other components of an application to perform actual processing. In the case of Spring MVC, DispatcherServlet is the front controller. The DispatcherServlet’s job is to send the request on to a Spring MVC controller.

Although we’re usingSpringBeanAutowiringSupport to enable autowiring for JAX-WS endpoints, it’s useful to enable autowiring support anywhere an object’s lifecycle is managed outside of Spring. The only requirement is that the Spring application context and the non-Spring runtime reside in the same web application.

In fact, the new URL has no query parameters at all. Although query parameters are still a legitimate way to send information to the server, they’re intended to provide guidance to the server in producing the resource. They shouldn’t be used to help identify a resource.

Idempotent methods may or may not change state, but repeated requests should have no further side effects after the first request. By definition, all safe methods are also idempotent, but not all idempotent methods are safe.

Quality is another strange variable. Often, by insisting on better quality you can get projects done sooner, or you can get more done in a given amount of time. This happened to me when I started writing unit tests (as described in Chapter 2, A Development Episode, page 7). As soon as I had my tests, I had so much more confidence in my code that I wrote faster, without stress. I could clean up my system more easily, which made further development easier. I've also seen this happen with teams. As soon as they start testing, or as soon as they agree on coding standards, they start going faster.

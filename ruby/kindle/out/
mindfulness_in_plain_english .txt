


The meditator focuses his mind upon some items, such as prayer, a certain type of box, a chant, a candle flame, a religious image or whatever, and excludes all other thoughts and perceptions from his consciousness. 



But they divide into two broad streams of thought -- Mahayana and Theravada. 



And just because of the simple fact that you are human, you find yourself heir to an inherent unsatisfactoriness in life which simply will not go away. You can suppress it from your awareness for a time. You can distract yourself for hours on end, but it always comes back--usually 



And then even that vague awareness fades away, and you are back to the same old reality. The world looks like the usual foul place, which is boring at best. It is an emotional roller coaster, and you spend a lot of your time down at the bottom of the ramp, 



a little wordless voice at the back of the head saying, "Not good enough yet. Got to have more. Got to make it better. Got to be better." It is a monster, a monster that manifests everywhere in subtle forms. 



The essence of life is suffering, said the Buddha. At first glance this seems exceedingly morbid and pessimistic. 



You can't ever get everything you want. It is impossible. Luckily, there is another option. You can learn to control your mind, to step outside of this endless cycle of desire and aversion. 



No one can do more for you than your own purified mind-- no parent, no relative, no friend, no one. A well-disciplined mind brings happiness". 



ourselves in some protective cocoon. That is not living. That is premature death. 



This sort of intuition can only occur when you disengage the logic circuits from the problem and give the deep mind the opportunity to cook up the solution. 



Seeking bliss from meditation introduces tension into the process, which blows the whole chain of events. It is a Catch-22. You can only have bliss if you don't chase it. 



Harm in the name of 



help is one of the oldest games. 



The traditional basic exercises consist of focusing the mind on a single object -- a stone, a candle flame, a syllable or whatever -- and not allowing it to wander. 



just sit, meaning that you toss out of your mind everything except pure awareness of sitting. This sounds very simple. It is not. A brief trial will demonstrate just how difficult it really is. 



he said to his followers was "Place no head above your own". By this he meant, don't accept somebody else's word. See for yourself. 



You pay no attention to that, either. Then one day you look 



around you. Your body is wrinkled and squeaky and you hurt. The book is a yellowed, useless lump; the building is caving in. So you pine for lost youth and you cry when the possessions are gone. Where does this pain come from? It comes from your own inattention. You failed to look closely at life. You failed to observe the constantly shifting flow 



A close inspection reveals that we have done the same thing to 'me' that we have done to all other perceptions. We have taken a flowing vortex of thought, feeling and sensation and we have solidified that into a mental construct. 



Don't expect anything. Just sit back and see what happens. Treat the whole thing as an experiment. 



Don't rush: There is no hurry, so take you time. 



Be gentle with yourself: Be kind to yourself. You may not be perfect, but you are all you've got to work with. The process of becoming who you will be begins first with the total acceptance of who 



the street may immediately think, "He is better looking than I am." The instant result is envy or shame. A girl seeing another girl may think, "I am prettier than she is." The instant result is pride. This sort of comparison is a mental habit, and it leads directly to ill feeling of one sort or another: greed, envy, pride, jealousy, hatred. 



Of course the person pointing out our mistakes himself may not be totally free from defects, but he can see our problems as we can see his faults, which he does not notice until we point them out to him. 



As meditators, we all must have a goal, for if we do not have a goal, we will simply be groping in the dark blindly following somebody's instructions on meditation. 



determined at the beginning. Suppose you change your original position because it is uncomfortable, and assume another position. What happens after a while is that the new position becomes uncomfortable. Then you want another and after a while, it too becomes uncomfortable. 



Once you sit, do not change the position again until the end of the time you 



After sitting motionless, close your eyes. 



After sitting in the manner explained earlier and having shared your loving-kindness with everybody, take three 



deep breaths. After taking three deep breaths, breathe normally, letting your breath flow in and out freely, effortlessly and begin focusing your attention on the rims of your nostrils. 



When the exhalation is complete, there is another brief pause before inhaling begins. Notice this brief pause, too. This means that there are two brief pauses of breath--one at the end of inhaling, and the other at the end of exhaling. 



Counting In a situation like this, 



counting may help. The purpose of counting is simply to focus the mind on the breath. 



While breathing in count "one, one, one, one..." until the lungs are full of fresh air. While breathing out count "two, two, two, two..." until the lungs are empty of fresh air. Then while breathing in again count "three, three, three, three..." until the lungs are full again and while breathing out count again 



The second method of counting is counting rapidly up to ten. While counting "one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine and ten" breathe in and again 



At this time count "one, two, three, four, five" (only up to five) while inhaling and then count "one, two, three, four, five, six" (up to six) while exhaling. 



The fourth method is to take a long breath. When the lungs are full, mentally count "one" and breath out completely until the lungs are empty of fresh air. Then count mentally "two". 



Connecting 



After joining inhaling and exhaling, fix your mind on the point where you feel you inhaling and exhaling breath touching. 



Similarly keep your mind straight on the point where you feel the breath at the rims of your nostrils. 



Simply notice the feeling of your inhaling and exhaling breath as it goes in and out right at the rims of your nostrils. 



breath appears at first as a gross sign. As you keep paying bare attention to it, this sign becomes very subtle. 



Here we see how even a small degree of desire for permanency in an impermanent situation causes pain or unhappiness. 



Meditation does not mean sitting in the lotus position. It is a mental skill. 



The most essential thing is to sit with your back straight. The spine should be erect with the spinal vertebrae held like a stack of coins, one on top of the other. Your head should be held in line with the rest of the spine. 



Choose one that is relatively firm and at least three inches thick when compressed. 



In these postures, your hands are cupped one on the other, and they rest on your lap with the palms turned upward. 



Pick one that has a level seat, a straight back and no arms. It is best to sit in such a way that your back does not lean against the back of the chair. 



remember your objectives. You want to achieve a state of complete physical stillness, yet you don't want to fall asleep. 



We sit, watching the air going in and out of our noses. 



Now exhale and notice the sensation at the same point. It is from this point that you will follow the whole passage of breath. Once you have located your own breath point with clarity, don't deviate from that spot. 



You will get dizzy. You fix your attention on the spot where the teeth of the blade dig into the wood. It is the only way you can saw a straight line. 



This does not mean, however, that you should be sitting there having little conversations with yourself inside your head: "There is a short ragged breath and there is a deep long one. I wonder what's next?" No, that is not Vipassana. That is thinking. 



It is peaceful, buoyant, and joyous energy which you can then apply to the problems of daily living. 



Find yourself a quiet place, a secluded place, a place where you will be alone. It doesn't have to be some ideal spot in the middle of a forest. That's nearly impossible for most of us, but it should be a place where you feel comfortable, 



You will probably find it helpful to sit in the same place each time. 



Many people find it helpful and supportive to sit with a group of other meditators. The discipline of regular practice is essential, and most people find it easier to sit regularly if they are bolstered by a commitment to a group sitting schedule. 



it is an activity which is very sensitive to the attitude with which you approach each session. What you expect is what you are most likely to get. 



First thing in the morning is a great time to meditate. 



meditation the first major thing you do in the morning. 



The evening is another good time for practice. Your mind is full of all the mental rubbish that you have accumulated during the day, and it is great to get rid of the burden before you sleep. 



Sit as long as you can, but don't overdo. Most beginners start with twenty or thirty minutes. 



We recommend that after a year or so of steady practice you should be sitting comfortable for an hour at a time. 



As a general rule, just determine what is a comfortable length of time for you at this point in your life. Then sit five minutes longer than that. 



Don't look at the clock until you think the whole meditation period has passed. 



To counteract this feeling, it is useful to know that you are not alone. Others have passed this way before. They have confronted that same barrier, 



You can use one idea to cancel another. You can balance a negative emotion by instilling a positive one. Giving is the opposite of greed. Benevolence is the opposite of hatred. 



At the beginning of each meditation session, say the following sentences to yourself. Really feel the intention: 1. May I be well, happy and peaceful. May no harm come to me. May no difficulties come to me. May no problems come to me. 



May I always meet with success. May I also have patience, courage, understanding, and determination to meet and overcome inevitable difficulties, problems, and failures in life. 2. May my parents be well, happy and peaceful. May no harm come to them. May no difficulties come to them. May no problems come to 



May my teachers be well, happy and peaceful. 



May my relatives be well, happy and peaceful. 



May my friends be well, happy and peaceful. 



May all indifferent persons be well, happy and peaceful. 



May my enemies be well, happy and peaceful. 



May all living beings be well, happy and peaceful. 



If you are miserable you are miserable; this is the reality, that is what is happening, so confront that. Look it square in the eye without flinching. When you are having a bad time, examine the badness, 



Handling pain is a two-stage process. First, get rid of the pain if possible or at least get rid of it as much as possible. Then, if some pain lingers, use it as an object of meditation. 



If you are very sleepy then take a deep breath and hold it as long as you can. Then breathe out slowly. Take another deep breath again, hold it as long as you can and breathe out slowly.

You feel you have failed in your practice. You have failed to be mindful. Simply become mindful of that sense of failure. You have just re-established your mindfulness with that single step. 



Missing a single practice session is scarcely important, but it very easily becomes a habit. It is wiser 



to push on through the resistance. Go sit anyway. Observe this feeling of aversion. 



You will have problems in meditation. Everybody does. You can treat them as terrible torments, or as challenges to be overcome. 



Just say to yourself, "Okay, I have been distracted for about two minutes" 



When your mind is wild and agitated, you can often re-establish mindfulness with a few quick deep breaths. 



When your mind is wild and agitated, you can often re-establish mindfulness with a few quick deep breaths. Pull the air in strongly and let it out the

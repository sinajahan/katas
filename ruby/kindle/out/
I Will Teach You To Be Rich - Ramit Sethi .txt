Rung 3: Open up a Roth IRA (see page 83) and contribute as much money as possible to it. 



Rung 4: If you have money left over, go back to your 401(k)

It’s a “retirement” account because it gives you large tax advantages if you agree not to withdraw your money from the account until your reach the retirement age of 59½. 



If you open one of these at any investment firm, you don’t get many tax advantages: For every $100 you make, you’ll be able to invest only about $75 of it because, depending on your tax rate, about 25 percent goes to pay income taxes. 



If you don’t see the money in your paycheck because it’s automatically sent to your 401(k), you’ll learn to live without it. 



Remember, the biggest problem most people have is not saving and investing at all, so don’t let worrying about how you’ll get your money out stop you.

surprised how quickly most cars depreciate and how others (Toyotas and Hondas especially) retain their value. 



If possible, buy a car at the end of the year, when dealers are salivating to beat their quotas and are far more willing to negotiate. 



I also highly recommend using Fighting Chance ( www.fightingchance.com), 



quotas—I faxed seventeen car dealers and told them exactly which car I wanted. 



As soon as you buy your car, enter the major maintenance 



I keep a record of each service I have, along with any notes. When I sell my car, I’ll show the documentation to the buyer to prove how meticulous I’ve been (and charge the buyer accordingly). 



In the olden days, this meant that your house would cost no more than 2.5 times your annual income, you’d be able to put at least 20 percent of the purchase price down, and the total monthly payments (including the mortgage, maintenance, 



Your first house probably won’t have as many bedrooms as you want. It won’t be in the most amazing location. 



Finally, will you be able to stay in the house for at least ten years? Buying a house means you’re staying put for a long time. 



Buy only if you’re planning to live in the same place for ten years or more. 



THE TRUTH: REAL ESTATE IS A POOR INVESTMENT FOR INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS 



It means you’ll need to save for a six-month emergency plan in case you lose your job and can’t pay your mortgage. 



Yale economist Robert Shiller found that “from 1890 through 1990, the return on residential real estate was just about zero after inflation.” 



But actually, they’ve forgotten to factor in important costs like property taxes, maintenance, and the opportunity cost of not having that money in the stock market. 



I want to show you why renting is actually a smart decision for many people, especially if you live in an expensive area like New York or San Francisco. 



If you do nothing with it (or, worse, spend it all), you might as well buy a house and use it 



excellent online calculator “Is It Better to Rent or Buy?” It will factor in maintenance, renovations, capital gains, the costs of buying and selling, inflation, and more. You can find it at www.nytimes.com/2007/04/10/business/2007_BUYRENT_GRAPHIC.html. 







I’m conservative when it comes to real estate. That means I urge you to stick by tried-and-true rules, like 20 percent down, a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, 



and a total monthly payment that represents no more than 30 percent of your gross pay. 



But most insidiously, net house prices haven’t increased when you factor in inflation, taxes, and other homeowner fees. 







to put as little as zero down—but it’s become all too clear that that was a very bad idea. 



shouldn’t be much more than three times your gross annual income. 



first-time homebuyers 



check with your employer, who may also offer special first-time home-buying 



if you don’t plan ahead, it ends up costing you much more in the end. 



1. Acknowledge that you’re probably not being realistic about how much things will 



2. Set up an automatic savings plan. 



3. You can’t have the best of everything, so use the P word. 



And whatever you do, negotiate the hell out of big-ticket purchases.

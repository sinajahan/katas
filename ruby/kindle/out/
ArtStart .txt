


You could spend all your time learning and not doing. And doing, not learning to do, is the essence of entrepreneurship. 



My4kpresumption is that your goal is to change the world—not study it. If 



microscopes and telescopes. 



Everyone should carefully observe which way his heart draws him, and then choose that way with all his strength. 



Make the world a better place. • Increase the quality of life. • Right a terrible wrong. • Prevent the end of something good. 



Successful companies are started, and made successful, by at least two, and usually more, soulmates. 



POLARIZE PEOPLE. When you create a product or service that some people love, don't be surprised when others hate you. 



Who has your money in their pockets? • How are you going to get it into your pocket? 



My final tip is that you ask women—and only women. My theory is that deep in the DNA of men is a "killer" gene. This gene expresses itself by making men want to kill people, animals, and plants. To a large degree, society has repressed this gene; 



The book The Darwin Awards provides irrefutable proof of women's greater common sense. 



Step 4: Ask a few women if they think you have a chance of selling that | many units. If they don't, you don't have a business model. 



If you miss any of them, your organization might die. • Finish a prototype. • Raise capital. • Ship a testable version to customers. • Ship the final version to customers. • Achieve breakeven. 



Employees must believe that what you do (that is, your positioning) makes the world a better place. 



It embodies such qualities as saving money and increasing revenue, as well as loftier concepts such as peace of mind, enlightenment, and joy. 



For example, "increase the security of Web sites" is a mediocre and vague value proposition, compared to "reduce the risk of fraud for commercial banks in their online transactions." 



"Doing business in this same spot for over fifty years." The next day Woolworth also put out a sign. It read: "Established a week ago: no old stock." 



DON'T COMPROMISE ON YOUR NAME 



To his dog, every man is Napoleon; hence the constant popularity of dogs. 



organization is not just marketing's and management's job: It's every employee's job. This is so important that you need to repeat the process as employees come and go—and 



Mend your speech a little, lest it may mar your fortunes. 



EXPLAIN YOURSELF IN THE FIRST MINUTE I've never sat through a pitch by an entrepreneur trying to raise money, an employee trying to get management approval for a new product, or a not-for-profit hoping to secure a grant and thought, I wish the 



speaker had spent the first fifteen minutes explaining his life story. 



imagine there was a little man sitting on his shoulder during presentations. Every time Bill said something, the little man would whisper, "So what?" to him. 



follow with the two most powerful words in a pitch: "For instance, . . .":;" 



Nothing in a pitch is more powerful than combining an answer to "So what?" with "For instance, ... " 



First, learn what's important to your audience. 



What attracted you to our idea and convinced you to give us an opportunity to meet? • Are there any special issues, questions, or landmines I should be prepared for in the meeting? • ten slides • twenty minutes 



thirty-point-font text • How old will the oldest person in the meeting be? 



Understand this: The purpose of a pitch is to stimulate interest, not to close a deal. Thus, the recommended number of slides for a pitch is small—ten or so. 



Ten slides and twenty minutes is all you get. 



Provide a complete view of the competitive landscape. 



Provide a five-year forecast containing not only dollars but also key metrics, 



good rule of thumb for font size is to divide the oldest investor's age by two, and use that font size. 



Next Steps End your presentation with a call to action such as a trial period or a test installation. 



"How much of your time may I have?" This question 



shows that you respect the value of the audience's time by not running over your limit. 



"I noticed that the CEO did a lot of talking, but the COO was sitting there taking notes. The CEO didn't write down a thing. 1 think the COO is a quality guy." 



visible act of taking notes says o I think you're smart. • You're saying something worth writing down. • I'm willing and anxious to learn. 9 I'm conscientious. Taking notes provides these benefits, plus the value of the information that you're recording. It can't get much better than this. 



You can make an even greater impression by also following through, within a day, on all the promises that you made during the pitch—for

or so pitches, throw away your presentation. Start with a clean slate and write the text from scratch.

USE A DARK BACKGROUND. A dark background communicates seriousness and substance. A white or light background looks cheap and amateurish. 



USE COMMON, SANS 



SERIF FONTS. 



You can never go wrong with Arial. 



To develop a memorable pitch, imagine that your audience is at the end of a long day of boring meetings; everyone is barely awake, much less attentive; and people just want to go home. 



I have always found that plans are useless, hut planning is indispensable. 



Thus, of the effort you put into writing a business plan, 80 percent should go into the executive summary. These are the most important paragraphs of your organization's existence. 



INCLUDE THE KEY 



METRICS, SUCH AS THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS, LOCATIONS, AND RESELLERS. 



DO NOT EXGEED TWENTY PAGES IN LENGTH. 



SIMPLIFY YOUR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS TO TWO PAGES. Investors don't care—and you have no way of knowing—how much you'll spend for pencils

how much money is going to be required until the company can support itself from its own cash flow. 



We like a few well-thought-out projections (by quarter for the first two years and annually for years 3, 4, and 5) that present a profit-and-loss statement, a balance sheet, and cash flow 



What's more important than the projection, however, are the assumptions used to reach 



Arial font for headings and Palatino font for text are just fine. 



There are four ways to make your plan stand out. First, have a credible referral source bring it to the attention of the reader. 



Second, provide a list of customers the reader can call 



Third, ensure that the plan is infused with real-world knowledge about and experience with the market. 



Fourth, include diagrams and graphics to explain complex points. 



On the revenue side, managing for cash flow means passing up sales that are profitable but take a long time to collect. On the expense side, it means stretching out payments for everything you buy. 



BUILD A BOTTOM-UP FORECAST 



Here's a typical top-down model: • There are 1.3 billion people. • 1 percent want Internet 



Each salesperson can make ten phone sales calls a day that get through to a prospect. • There are 240 working days per year. • Five percent of the sales calls will convert

In the long run, a service business is fundamentally different from a product business. 



Negotiate everything. Circa 2004, everything is negotiable: rates, payment schedules, and monthly fees.

Good people accept accountability. Great people ask for it. 



Everyone in a given company is in denial about something. 



Everyone in a given company is in denial about something. Some denial is good for an entrepreneur— for example, denying that the "experts" are right when they say you can't succeed. The critical issue is whether the denial is ultimately going to hurt the organization. 



A players hire A players; B

Failure, however, is usually a better teacher than success. The candidate to avoid, though, is one who has a consistent history of working for failures. 



For example, ask the following kinds of questions for a vice president of marketing position: How did you manage a product introduction? How did you determine the feature set of a new product? How did you convince engineering to implement these features? 



"What are the accomplishments you're most proud of?" "What were your biggest failures?" "What was your most gratifying learning experience?" 



should only hire and keep people that you'd hustle over to and engage in a conversation. If you find yourself picking option 2 or 3, don't make the hire. Life is too short to work with people you don't naturally like—especially in a young, small organization. 



I'm working with my best friend. Do I really need a legal agreement? A. Yes, absolutely. 



What is a reasonable enticement and compensation for a member of my board of directors? A. The range is usually .25 to .5 percent, but for an 



absolute superstar, I'd go as high as 1 to 2 percent of the company. If it takes more than this to get the candidate, move on. 



If you want to get an investment, show that you will build a business. Make meaning. Make a difference. Don't do it for the money. Do it because you want to make the world a better place. 



As venture capitalist Hunt Green said, "Everything is always impossible before it works. 



Investors are impressed by the suggestions of professors.

"I've done OK so far, getting us to this point. But if it ever becomes necessary, I'll step aside." 



Did you try to establish contact after the pitch? • Did you answer questions that came up in the pitch? • Did you provide supplemental information that supports your case?

My parents told me I could learn how to live my life by watching others live their lives. 



"Well, I guess I should have known that," I responded. "Yeah, I guess you should have," 



I didn't try to be anyone I wasn't. I didn't overstretch and pretend to know more than I did. Many people believe that's what it takes when reaching out to those above you, but in truth that often results in making a jerk out of yourself. 



"Listen, I'm still up in the air," I told him. "But it would help if I had dinner with you and a few partners to get a better feel for what I'd be doing and where the organization is headed." 



accept your offer, all I ask is that you give me three dinners a year at this very restaurant for as long as I'm at Deloitte. I'm in if you're in." 



You learn in your twenties, as the saying goes, and earn in your thirties.

on the job, they'll ask these new employees to jot down all their impressions with the idea that a pair of fresh eyes can see old problems and make innovative suggestions that others can't. 



"Connecting should advance, rather than compromise, your principles." 



I started to realize that connecting was actually a way of seeing the world. 



The important thing is to see connecting with others not just as another manipulative tool used toward achieving a goal but rather as a way of life. When you're out of balance, you'll know because you'll be rushed, angry, and unfulfilled. 



The way you reach out to others is the way you eat an 800-pound elephant: one small bite at a time.

How many people can walk into our homes and just open up the fridge and 



help themselves? Not many. People need "refrigerator rights relationships," the kind that are comfortable, informal, and intimate enough to let us walk into one another's kitchens and rummage through the refrigerator without asking. It is close relationships like these that keep us well-adjusted, happy, and successful.

Sooner or later, in one way or another, we all will ask ourselves these questions. Moreover, we'll look back on 



our life and wonder, What is my legacy? What have I done that is meaningful? How many of you can recall the names of the last three CEOs of General Motors, IBM, or Wal-Mart? Are you struggling to come up with names? Now try and recall three important figures in the Civil Rights Movement. Ah, here people usually can name six or more.

Vipassana, we were told, is an insight meditation technique that means "to see things as they really are." It was a technology for inner peace that could drive fear from the heart and help us have the courage to be who we really are. 



that it could be important, that it could make a difference, and that we could learn to be happy if only we took the time to listen to what our souls 



but so few of us give ourselves the time and space we need to come to a better understanding of who we are and what we really want. 



your passion? What truly gives you pleasure? How can you make a difference? 



We find meaning, love, and prosperity through the process of stitching together our bold attempts to help others find their own way in their lives.

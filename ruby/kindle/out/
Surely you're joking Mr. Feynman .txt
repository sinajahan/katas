


everything's all right. So the guy says, "What are you doing? You come to fix the radio, but you're only walking back and forth!" I say, "I'm thinking!" 



saying, "He fixes radios by thinking!" The whole idea of thinking, to fix a radio --a little boy stops and thinks, and figures out how to do it--he never thought that was possible. 



Once I get on a puzzle, I can't get off. If my mother's friend had said, "Never mind, it's too much work," I'd have blown my top, because I want to beat this damn thing, as long as I've gone this far. I can't just leave it after I've found out so much about it. I have to keep going to find out ult imately what is the matter with it in the end. 



trigonometry, I didn't like the symbols for sine, cosine, tangent, and so on. To me, "sin f" looked like s times i times n times f! So I invented another symbol, like a square root sign, that was a sigma with a long arm sticking out of it, 



and help each other out. Everyone had to have a grade level of at least such-and-such. If they were sliding behind, the guys who studied all the time would teach them and help them do their work. On the other side, everybody had to go to every dance. If a guy didn't know how to get a date, the other guys would get him a date. 



I realized what that was. When someone wants to make a side remark or interrupt you, he can't yell, "Hey, Jack!" He can only make a signal, which you won't catch unless you're in the habit of looking around all the time. 



Then I slipped out the card (no water leaks out because no air can come in --the rim is too close to the table for that). 



The schoolteacher asks, "Which one of us is right?" I said, "You'll have to go ask the girls--they understood what language it was right away." 



Then, when I was getting tired, I noticed that I could think of two things at once. I discovered this when I was talking internally to myself about something, and while I was doing this, I was idly imagining two ropes connected to the end of my bed, 



"Absolutely guaranteed that this knocking is coming from outside my dream, and I've invented this part of the dream to fit with it. 



So I found hypnosis to be a very interesting experience. All the time you're saying to yourself, "I could do that, but I won't"--which is just another way of saying that you can't. 



question that was very interesting, and that nobody knew the answer to. 



But that was my big moment: I gave a seminar in the biology department of Harvard! I always do that, get into something and see how far I can go. 



the moment I start to think about the physics, and have to concentrate on what I'm explaining, nothing else occupies my mind--I'm completely immune to being nervous. So after I started to go, I just didn't know who was in the room. I was only explaining this idea, that's all. 



which I still use today when somebody is explaining something that I'm trying to understand: I keep making up examples. 



So I got a great reputation for doing integrals, only because my box of tools was different from everybody else's, and they had tried all their tools on it before giving the problem to me. 



on my foot, And there I was, this scientific wonder, saying it wasn't going to sting me. 



I'll wait awhile. Maybe something will happen where they can use me more effectively" 



not as incapable as they think they are: it's just that they carry their nose so high off the ground! 



each one thinking of a new facet, while remembering what the other fella said, so that, at the end, the decision is made as to which idea was the best --summing it all up --without having to say it three times. These were very great men indeed. 



physicists had nothing to do until their buildings and apparatus were ready, so they just built the buildings--or assisted in building the buildings. 



when I hear about physics, I just think about physics, and I don't know who I'm talking to, so I say dopey things like "no, no, you're wrong," or "you're crazy." 



inform you not to mention censorship in your letters." Phoom, phoooom , it comes right back! So I write, "I have been instructed to inform my wife not t o mention censorship. How in the heck am I going to do it? 



Like the hole in the fence, I was always trying to point these things out in a non-direct manner. 



The trouble with playing a trick on a highly intelligent man like Mr. Teller is that the timeit takes him to figure out from the moment that he sees there is something wrong till he understands exactly what happened is too damn small to give you any pleasure! 



in five minutes. So I have a great deal of respect for these military guys, because I never can decide anything 



very important in any length of time at all. 



Right away it would have been OK. But now they've been talking a little bit too long. You hesitated too long. If you ask them now they'll say "What are you wasting my time all this time for?" 



fighting a war! We see what it is!" They knew what the numbers meant. If the pressure came out higher, that meant there was more energy released, and so on and so on. They knew what they were doing. Complete transformation! They began to invent ways of doing it better. 



asked me what happened. "She's dead. And how's the program going?" They caught on right away that I didn't want to moon over it. 



cry until a number of months later, when I was in Oak Ridge. I was walking past a department store with dresses in the window, and I thought Arlene would like one of them. That was too much for me.) 



"Remember the name of that little fellow in the back 



over there? He's the only guy who's not afraid of me, and will say when I've got a crazy idea. So next time when we want to discuss ideas, we're not going to be able to do it with these guys who say everything is yes, yes, Dr. Bohr. Get that guy and we'll talk with him first." 



I began to think, you know, about how much the radius of the Hiroshima bomb damage was and so forth . . . How far from here was 34th Street? . . . All those buildings, all smashed--and so on. And I would go along and I would see people building a bridge, or they'd be makin g a new 



Los Alamos was a very cooperative place, and we 



felt it our responsibility to point out things that should be improved. 



The questions of the students are often the source of new research. 



"Yes, but did you look at his picture?" "What possible difference could that make?" I exclaimed. 



I said, "And there, have you got science? No! You have only told what a word means in terms of other words. You haven't told anything about nature-what crystals produce light when you crush them, why they produce light. 



And you worry, and try to decide, but then something else comes up. It's much easier to just plain decide. Never mind-nothing is going to change your mind. 



When you're young, you have all these things to worry about --should you go there, what about your 



to go through the whole works with me, just so I could check that the thing was really giving results that fit fairly well, and that it was a significantly good theory. I'll never make that mistake again, reading the experts' opinions. 



I'd say things like, "Artists are lost: they don't have any subject! They used to have the religious subjects, but they lost their religion and now they haven't got anything. They don't understand the technical world they live in; they don't know anything about the beauty of the real world--the 



With the other models, if you draw something a little too big or bit too small, it doesn 't make any difference because it's all out of shape anyway. But when you're trying to draw something that's so well put together, you can't fool yourself: It's got to be just right! 



You can make something that somebody likes so muchthat they're depressed, or they're happy, on account of that damn thing you made! In science, it's sort of general and large: You don't know the individuals who have appreciated it directly. 



He said, "You know, you're never going to draw again." "What? That's ridiculous! Why should I never. "Because you've had a one-man show, and you're only an amateur." Although I did draw after that, I never worked as hard, with the same energy and intensity, as I did before. 



The Talmud is a wonderful book, a great, big potpourri of things: trivial questions, and difficult questions--for 



It turned out that the blank book had a rating by some of the other members! They couldn't believe it was blank, because they had a rating. In fact, the rating for the missing book was a little bit higher than for the two others. The fact that there was nothing in the book had nothing to do with the rating. 



The ambassador answered in a way I like to hear: "I don't know," he said. "I might suppose something, but I don't know if it's true.
